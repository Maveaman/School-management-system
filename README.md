About School Management System:
School Management Systems manage all the information of the students and/or faculty in a particular school. In our project, we will only use it to manage some basic personal information of the students of a school.

Project Prerequisites
To build this project, we will need the following libraries:

Tkinter – To create the GUI.
SQLite3 – To connect the program to the database and store information in it.
TkCalender – To get the user to enter a date.
Datetime.date – To convert the date from the tree to a Datetime.date instance so that it can be set in.
Tkinter.messagebox – To show a display box, displaying some information or an error.
Tkinter.ttk – To create the tree where all the information will be displayed.
